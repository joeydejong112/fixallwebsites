## What This Project Is

**ScanPulse** — A website health scanner SaaS. Users enter any URL and get an instant report across three pillars: Security, Performance, and SEO. Built for freelancers, developers, and agency clients.

- **Repo**: `C:\Users\Joey\Documents\JDJFreelance\fixallwebsites`
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/joeydejong112/fixallwebsites
- **Convex prod**: https://hip-bass-536.eu-west-1.convex.cloud
- **Dev server**: http://localhost:3000 (never run `npm run dev` — use Chrome extension for verification)

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Nuxt 4 (SSR, `app/` directory) |
| UI | Tailwind CSS (custom design tokens, no component library) |
| Auth | Clerk (`@clerk/nuxt` v2) |
| Backend / DB | Convex (serverless functions + reactive database) |
| Fonts | Space Grotesk (display) + DM Sans (body) |
| Animations | anime.js (client-only, always dynamic import) |
| Language | TypeScript throughout |

---

## Rules Claude Must Follow

- Always use **context7** plugin for documentation lookups before writing Convex or framework code
- Always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` before touching any Convex code
- Never run `npm run dev` — server is already running; use Chrome extension for visual checks
- Never work in git worktrees — commit directly to `main` or a branch
- Never save files to the root folder
- Always run `npx convex deploy --yes` after changing any file in `convex/`
- Always commit and push after completing a task (conventional commit format)
- Dispatch a security-auditor subagent after each task before committing

|-------|------|-------|
| `clerkId` | string | Indexed via `by_clerk` |
| `email` | string | |
| `name` | string? | |
| `plan` | `'free' \| 'pro'` | Default: `'free'` |
| `scanCount` | number | Lifetime scans, enforced at 10 for free |

### `scans` table
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `userId` | string | Clerk user ID |
| `url` | string | Target URL |
| `status` | `'pending' \| 'running' \| 'done' \| 'error'` | |
| `securityScore` | number? | 0–100 |
| `performanceScore` | number? | 0–100 |

---

## Scan Engine (12 checks)

### Security (5)
1. HTTPS enforced
2. `Strict-Transport-Security` header
3. `Content-Security-Policy` header
4. `X-Frame-Options` or CSP `frame-ancestors`
5. `X-Content-Type-Options` header

### Performance (3)
1. TTFB ≤ 400ms (critical if >800ms)
2. Compression (gzip or Brotli)
3. Images have `width`/`height` attributes

### SEO (4)
1. `<title>` present and 10–60 chars
2. `<meta name="description">` present
3. Exactly one `<h1>`
4. `<link rel="canonical">` present

Scores: `(passing / total) × 100`. Overall = average of three pillars.

## Phase History

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ Complete (2026-03-25)
- Nuxt 4 project scaffolded with Clerk, Convex, Tailwind, anime.js
- All global CSS and design tokens set up
- Logo, NavBar, ScanInput components built
- Auth middleware + Clerk sign-in/sign-up pages
- Convex schema deployed (users + scans tables)
- All Convex functions: `createScan`, `getScan`, `getScansByUser`, `updateScan`, `runScan`
- Landing page — full editorial design with animated hero
- Dashboard page — scan history with score rings and pillar bars
- Results page — polling, score display, issue list with severity tabs

### Phase 2 — Auth & User ✅ Complete (2026-03-26)

**What was built:**
- `convex/users.ts` — `upsertUser` (internalMutation) + `getUserByClerkId` (projected query)
- `convex/http.ts` — Clerk webhook handler at `/clerk` POST
  - Verifies Svix HMAC-SHA256 signature using native `crypto.subtle` (no npm dep — Convex edge runtime can't bundle svix)
  - Guards against empty email
  - Calls `upsertUser` on `user.created` and `user.updated` events
- `convex/scans.ts` — `createScan` refactored to be fully atomic: check free-tier limit + insert + increment scanCount in one mutation (prevents race condition)
- `app/pages/dashboard/index.vue` — fixed:
  - Replaced `onMounted` early-return with `watch(userId, ...)` for correct Clerk hydration timing
  - Replaced `Promise.all` with `Promise.allSettled` so scan list loads even if `getUserByClerkId` fails
  - Plan badge shows `X / 10 free` for free users, `Pro` for pro users

**Key bugs fixed along the way:**
- Missing `convex/package.json` (lost in squash merge) — recreated
- `"use node"` directive not allowed in `http.ts` (HTTP actions are edge-only) — removed, replaced svix with native HMAC
- Convex deploy failing due to unresolvable `svix` import — fixed by native implementation

**Manual setup still required (one-time, done in Clerk/Convex dashboards):**
- Add Clerk webhook pointing to `https://hip-bass-536.eu-west-1.convex.cloud/clerk`
- Set `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var in Convex dashboard

## Phase 2 — Remaining Work

### Dashboard
- [x] Real-time scan history (Convex subscription via `onUpdate`)
- [x] Delete scan from history
- [x] Re-scan button on each row
- [x] Filter by pillar / status

### Results
- [x] PDF export
- [x] Share link (public results URL)
- [x] Compare with previous scan of same URL
- [x] Fix recommendations with code examples

### Monitoring
- [ ] Scheduled scans via Convex crons
- [ ] Email alerts when score drops below threshold
- [ ] Dashboard widget for monitored sites

### Billing
- [ ] Stripe integration for Pro tier
- [ ] Pro: unlimited scans, PDF reports, monitoring, API access

## Phase 2.5 — Best-in-Class Scan Engine (Not Started)

> Goal: own all pillars in one tool. Competitors each cover one area. We cover all four.

### Security (expand 5 → 15+ checks)
- [ ] SSL expiry + TLS version + cipher strength

- [ ] Subresource Integrity (SRI) on external scripts
- [ ] Sensitive file exposure probe (.env, .git, phpinfo)
- [ ] CORS misconfiguration
- [ ] Redirect chain audit

### Performance (expand 3 → 12+ checks)

## Known Issues / Decisions

| Issue | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| svix can't be bundled in Convex edge runtime | Replaced with native `crypto.subtle` HMAC-SHA256 |
| `scanCount` in stat strip caps at 20 (`.take(20)`) | Cosmetic inconsistency — deferred |
| Plan upgrade via Clerk metadata not handled in `upsertUser` | Out of scope until billing phase |
| Caller-supplied `userId` in scanAction (minor attack surface) | Accepted for now, harden in security pass |
| Scans don't live-update on dashboard | Deferred — Phase 2 Dashboard item |

## Last Session

**Date**: 2026-04-07
**What was done**:
- Completed Phase 7 (Score History & Trend Charts) — all 6 tasks:
  - T1: `scoreHistory` table added to `convex/schema.ts` with `by_user_url` + `by_user_url_ts` indexes
  - T2: `convex/scoreHistory.ts` — `recordSnapshot` (internalMutation), `getHistory`, `getHistoryForUser`, `getRecentHistory`
  - T3: Wired `recordSnapshot` into `convex/scanAction.ts` — calls after every successful scan; added `getScanInternal` internalQuery to `scans.ts` to fetch `userId`
  - T4: `app/components/TrendChart.vue` — pure SVG sparkline: area fill, polyline, regression dots (red on ≥10pt drops), hover tooltip
  - T5: `app/pages/history/index.vue` — full history page (query param `?url=`): 6-pillar summary cards, full overall trend chart, per-pillar sparkline grid, scan log table linking back to scan results
  - T6: Dashboard sparklines — loads last 15 scores per unique URL via `getRecentHistory`, renders `TrendChart` + "history" link in each scan row; Convex deployed successfully

- Completed Phase 8 (Competitor Scan) — all 4 tasks:
  - T1: `app/pages/compare/index.vue` — two URL inputs, swap button, ProGate, recent comparisons from localStorage
  - T2: `convex/compare.ts` — `compareScans` action: creates two scans, fires both `runScan` concurrently via scheduler
  - T3: `app/pages/compare/[scanIdA]/[scanIdB].vue` — polling results page: dual score rings with delta badge, pillar comparison table sorted by gap, "Fix to catch up" issue diff, "You're ahead" strengths section, share/PDF export
  - T4: Dashboard Competitor Scans widget (last 3 from localStorage), NavBar "Compare" link (pink); Convex deployed

**Where we left off**: Phase 8 complete. Next: Phase 9 (Public API, Pro).

**Branch**: `main` (all work committed directly, no open branches)
